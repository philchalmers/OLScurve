#OLScurve

Ordinary least squares regression for examining individual growth trajectories.  Produces plots that can be used for both informative and diagnostic purposes.

##Description

Provides tools for organizing, calculating, and
plotting ordinary least squares growth curve trajectories. These
type of models are typically used to diagnose the effectiveness
of a specified time functional form at the individual level rather
than at the group level (where FIML estimation is required).
