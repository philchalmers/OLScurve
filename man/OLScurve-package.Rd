\description{
OLS growth curve trajectories
}
\details{
Provides tools for organizing, calculating, and
plotting ordinary least squares growth curve trajectories. These
type of models are typically used to diagnose the effectiveness
of a specified time functional form at the individual level rather
than at the group level (where FIML estimation is required).
