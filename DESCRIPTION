Description: Provides tools for organizing, calculating, and
    plotting ordinary least squares growth curve trajectories. These
    type of models are typically used to diagnose the effectiveness
    of a specified time functional form at the individual level rather
    than at the group level (where FIML estimation is required).
Depends:
    lattice
LazyLoad: yes
